# Javascript Foundation.

<!-- Our photos,videos and application on the computer resides on the SSD. But when u run that application then its stores to the RAM and provides data -->

## Why languages??
- We know our machine only understands 0's and 1's, and on the other side we the developers find it difficult to write the programs in the 0's and 1's so usually we write code in the language that we understand. But the question is how does a machine understand??
- With the help of compilers which under the hood can convert our logical statements into machine language.

## Why do we have so many languages??
- Because people have so many optimizations and some use cases can only be built in certain languages.
- Example :- Brower/websites can only be  written  in html,css and js
But in the end every programming language needs to be converted into zeros and ones.

## Interpreted vs Compiler. 

1. What is a Compiler ?
  - Compilers convert high-level developer-friendly code into 0s and 1s.
  - Examples of  compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

> When u compile the code which is written in C++ , first it goes through the code and produces the output file, later it  runs the program only if code seems to be correct.

2. What is Interpreted ?
  - Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command.
  - Examples of  interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

> Usually (interpreted languages) go line by line.It can run partially if the error occurs in the later stage of code.

### Where to run javascript code.
1. In Source code Editor (Visual Studio)  - Create a file name with js extension. Write the code inside it and open the terminal and write the command `node file_name.js` to run the code 
2. In repl.it - It lets you compile code without having it locally on your machine.
Sign in to repl.it, Click on create Repl and choose the runtime environment i.e Node to run js file. 
 
## Why js is better than other languages
- Browsers can only understands html,css and js which is not technically true because u can create websites in C++  but in 99.9% of websites Js is the primary language.
HTML,CSS and JS is the standard language to create website.Websites cannnot be run without js.
- Js can also be used in Backend development , so  This is the reason why JS is popular than other language.

> Note: Js is Single threaded and Dynamic languages

## Javascript Basic

### Simple Primitive.
- Variables.
    1. Using Var
    ```
    var myVar = 10;  // Declaring a variable 'myVar' and assigning a value of 10

    ```
    2. Using Let
    Values can be reassigned.
    ```
    let myVar = 10; // Declaring a variable 'myVar' and assigning a value of 10

    ```
    3. Using const
    It cannot change the value once it is assigned.
    ```
    const myConst = 5; // Declaring a constant 'myConst' and assigning a value of 5

    ```
- Data types.
    1. Numbers
    ```
    let numInteger = 10; // Integer
    let numFloat = 3.14; // Float
    ```

    2. Strings
    ```
   let greet = "Hello, World!"; // String
    ```

    3. Booleans.
    ```
    let boolValue = true; // Or false
    ```
- Loops.(For Loop)
##### Syntax:
>for (initialization; condition; incr/decr) 
{
    // code block to be executed
}
##### Exercises
```
// Write a program to greet a person given their first and last name.

let firstname = 'Likitha'
var lastname = 'N'
console.log('Hlo'+ ' ' + firstname + '.'+ lastname)
```

```
// Write a program to greet a person based on their gender.

let firstname = 'Arjun'
let lastname = 'Reddy'
let isfemale = true //Booleans

if(isfemale == true){
  console.log('Hlo'+ ' ' + firstname + '.'+ lastname)
}
else{
  console.log('heyy')
}

```

```
// Write a program that counts  from  0-1000 and prints  

let result = 0

for(let i=0; i<=1000 ;i++){
  result = result + i;
}
console.log(result)

```

### Complex Primitive.
1. Array

```
// Creating an array of numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Creating an array of strings
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

// Creating an array with mixed data types
let mixedArray = [1, 'Hello', true, { key: 'value' }];

```

**Accessing Array Elements:**
 -Array elements are accessed using zero-based indexing.
##### Examples:
```
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: 'Apple'
console.log(fruits[2]); // Output: 'Orange'
```

2. Objects.

```
// Creating an array of objects
let students = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 20, grade: 'A' },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 22, grade: 'B' },
    { name: 'Charlie', age: 21, grade: 'A-' }
];

```
**Accessing elements in the array and their properties**
```
console.log(students[0].name); // Output: 'Alice'
console.log(students[1].age); // Output: 22
console.log(students[2].grade); // Output: 'A-'
```
##### Exercises

```
// Write  a program that prints  all the even numbers in the array
let number = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10]

-1st method

for (let i = 0; i < number.length; i++) {
  if (number[i] % 2 == 0) {
    console.log(number[i]);
  }
}


-2nd method

let i=0
while (i < number.length) {
  if (number[i] % 2 == 0) {
    console.log(number[i]);
  }
  i++;
}

-3rd method

number.forEach((e)=>{
  if(e%2 == 0){
    console.log(e)
  }
})

```

```
// Write a program to print a biggest number in an array

let a = [1,30,54,400,3,-5]

let largest = a[0];

for(let i=0 ;i<a.length ;i++){
  if(a[i] > largest ){
    largest = a[i]
  }
}
console.log(largest)

```

```
// Write a program to print all the female people's first name given a complex object.

let user_details = [
  {
    firstname: "likitha",
    gender: 'female',
  },
  {
   firstname: "spoorthi",
   gender: 'female',
  },
  {
   firstname: "ajay",
   gender: 'male',
  },
  ];
  
  for(let i=0;i<user_details.length;i++){
    if(user_details[i].gender == 'female'){
      console.log(user_details[i])
    }
  }

```

```
// Write a program that reverse all the elements of an array.

1st Method:

let a =[2,3,45,7,100]
let b=[] //Empty array to store the reverse value

for(let i= a.length-1;i>=0 ;i--){
  b.push(a[i]);
}
console.log(b)

2nd Method:

let a =[2,3,45,7,100]

let b = a.reverse()
console.log(b)

```

### Functions.
-In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code that can be defined and then called to perform a specific task or return a value.
 ```
 // Function that finds the sum of  two numbers and returns the result

function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Calling the function and storing the result in a variable

let sum = addNumbers(5, 3);

console.log(sum); // Output: 8

 ```



#### Callback fuctions
- Can u call one function inside another function ?? Yes!!
```
// Function that performs a simple math operation

function add(a, b, callback) {
  const sum = a + b;
  // Invoke the callback function and pass the result as an argument
  callback(sum);
}

// Callback function to display the result

function displayResult(result) {
  console.log(`The result is: ${result}`);
}

// Calling the 'add' function and passing a callback function.

add(5, 3, displayResult); // Output: The result is: 8

```
>This demonstrates a basic usage of a callback function where the displayResult function acts as a callback to handle the result generated by the add function. 


Let me give the another example for callback function i.e SetTimeout

```
Ex: 

function time(){
  console.log('hi')
}

setTimeout(time,5000)

- Here setTimeout is function which is calling another function i.e Time . setTimeout takes two aruguments : 1. Function , 2.Time in milli seconds.
After certain milli seconds the function will be called.

```



Assignements.

```
// Create a counter in js (counts down from 30 to 0)

Method 1:

let count = 30
console.log('counter:'+ count)

function counter(){
  if(count > 0){
    count --
    console.log('counter:'+ count)
  }
  else{
    clearInterval(counter)
  }

}

setInterval(counter,1000)


Method 2:

function counter(seconds) {
  function count() {
    if (seconds > 0) {
      console.log(seconds);
      seconds--;
      setTimeout(count,1000)
    }
    else{
      console.log('completed')
    }
  }
   
  count()
}
counter(30);


```

```
// Calculate a time it takes  between a setTimeout call and the inner function actually running

const starttime = performance.now();


setTimeout(()=>{
const endtime = performance.now()

const res = endtime - starttime
console.log('The consume time is'+' ' + res)

console.log('this is callback function')

},1000)


```

```
// Create a terminal clock

function clock(){
let time = new Date();

const currenthour = time.getHours();
const currentmin = time.getMinutes();
const currentsec = time.getSeconds();

let terminalclock = `${currenthour}:${currentmin}:${currentsec}`
console.clear()

console.log(terminalclock)

}

setInterval(clock,1000)

```
